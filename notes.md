# Week two process

- Started by listening to the introduction audio/podcast by the professor.  
- After, i downloaded Anaconda and installed it.  (Successful install) and proceeded to follow the instructions.


# Issues
- Had a bit of trouble installing Homebrew
  - I thought you misspelled the word user by writing usr instead. Turns out the command line is correct.
  - Turns out im just dumb and didnt actually read the words "Mac Users"
- tried running "wget -r -np -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/" but recieved a error.
  - Error said  __Cannot convert the "2" value of type "System.Int32" to type
    "Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestSession".__
  - Problem was resolved by adding .exe to the end of the wget command. (I did have wget in my windows folder so im not super sure why the first step worked but not the second.)
