-Used Anaconda Powershell to download clones of website pages onto my pc.
-Wget was the program that actually aquired the pages, Anaconda Powershell was the framework that ran the code.

# Powershell syntaxes #
- pwd = print working directory
- dir = directory
- cd = Calls a sub-directory
- mkdir = Makes a new directory/folder


# Wget syntaxes #
-r = recursive
-np = no-parent
-l = links beyond domain we started in
-w  = wait/delay between actions
--limit-rate= limit the bandwidth/speed of download.


# OCR #
-Need to install/import library plugins, much like Java.
- image_ocr() = extracting text from picture
- "<-" = creates a variable
