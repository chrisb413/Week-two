# Week two process #

- Started by listening to the introduction audio/podcast by the professor.  
- Wanted to learn how to use Rstudio to convert images of text into text.  I feel like this could be a really useful tool especially if it can work with different languages.  
  - I often find myself watching some "How to" videos about a game mechanic that is in Russian. The ability to convert onscreen/video text into text that i cant highlight and copy/paste into a translator is huge.
- After, i downloaded Anaconda and installed it.  (Successful install) and proceeded to follow the instructions.


# Issues #
- Had a bit of trouble installing Homebrew
  - I thought you misspelled the word user by writing usr instead. Turns out the command line is correct.
  - Turns out im just dumb and didnt actually read the words "Mac Users"
- tried running "wget -r -np -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/" but recieved a error.
  - Error said  __Cannot convert the "2" value of type "System.Int32" to type
    "Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestSession".__
  - Problem was resolved by adding .exe to the end of the wget command. (I did have wget in my windows folder so im not super sure why the first step worked but not the second.)
  
  
  ## Steps: (aka, Issues continued) ##
Tried installing RStudio in Anaconda Navigator but it kept getting stuck on a infinite download loop.
- Tried running as admin and the problem continued.  Did a quick look on the internet and some people also ran into this problem.  They recommended just downloading it seperately from the actual company website.
- Decided to just install RStudio and R on my pc manually.  Also had to download RTools as well.

-Had issue intalling magick, and tesseract which resulted in a few errors.  Fixed simply by installing them one at a time rather than together.
-After setting the workspace to a folder i created RStudio still put the .RHistory file somewhere else on my computer.  Rebooted the program and followed the instructions again.  It worked the second time.
-Text was successfully copied from the picture you told us to use.

-Repeated the process with the multi-file method and that worked also.



# Reflection questions: #
In your journal.md for this week, think about, who pays for work to end up online? Who does the work? 
What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? 
Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? 
What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? 
Where do you fit into this digital history machine? Put your journal.md into your github repo for week 2.

- I feel like Universities and companies like JSTOR would pay people to digitize content.
- Researchers, and volunteers. Everyone, to some degree. 
(Everyone records what they do day-to-day.  Journalists, novelists, painters, directors, etc.  Everything gets put on the internet now adays.)
- Being responsible for digitizing a transcription or otherwork is quite the task.  It requires being precise and not cutting corners or interpreting what should/not be included.
-Carleton offers access to many online databases. JSTOR for instance.  They (i think) let you download a section of the pdf for a few days.  
- Some of the barriers are obviously the several points where logging in is required.  Also not being able to download/copy text from the documents is annoying. (*I often use a text-to-speech program (Balabolka) to read information quicker as i read at something like 200wpm.)
	-Some online books/documents have text but you cannot highlight/copy the text.  This lesson might have remedied part of the problem.
- I consume digital history.  I dont produce any real form of content online.  (Even broadening "digital history" to something like social media, im still basically non-existent).
